This project was conducted as part of the EC3102 course at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST).
The team members who collaborated on this project are [woojin0408] and [Glorybean].

Through our research, our team discovered that the issue of social isolation and the increasing depression among the middle-aged and elderly population in Korea is severe. 
We also found that if the increase in depression is left unaddressed, there is a high possibility that it can lead to dementia. 
Studies on the correlation between depression and dementia support this. 

Therefore, we developed an application called “Inthemorning(아침에)” that aims to prevent dementia and detect risky situations by having users answer simple dementia prevention questions directly. 
This was done to contribute to alleviating social problems occurring in Korea.
